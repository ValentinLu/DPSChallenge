Hello everyone,
this is the readme for the interview challange of the digital product school Munich. I would like to introduce you here to the technical aspekts of the challange, insights and discuss decisions I made during the tasks.

1. Visualisation

![Total accidents resulting in personalinjury](https://github.com/ValentinLu/DPSChallenge/blob/main/Code%20Notebook/yearly_personalinjury.png)
As you can see from the plot, 50% of alcohol-related accidents result in personal injury. In hit-and-run accidents, only 5% of accidents result in injury or death. Since the rate for all observed accidents is about 23%, this could indicate that serious hit-and-runs are rare and that most drivers help injured people.
