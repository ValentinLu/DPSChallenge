Interview Challange for DPS #Patch19


Hello everyone,
this is the readme for the interview challange of the digital product school Munich. I would like to introduce you here to the technical aspekts of the challange, insights and discuss decisions I made during the tasks.

1. Visualisation

Legend - Category: Alkoholunfälle = 0; Fluchtunfälle = 1; Verkehrsunfäll = 2;
Type: Insgesamt = 0; Personenschäden = 1; 
Verletzte und Getötete = 2

As you can see from the plot, 50% of alcohol-related accidents result in personal injury. In hit-and-run accidents, only 5% of accidents result in injury or death. Since the rate for all observed accidents is about 23%, this could indicate that serious hit-and-runs are rare and that most drivers help injured people.

The plot below is showing that there are no major anomalies or outliers. for example, one might assume that alcohol accidents increase during octoberfest, which is not the case. However, it is easy to see how with the onset of the Corona pandemic in 2020, traffic accidents decreased overall due to lockdowns, etc.
