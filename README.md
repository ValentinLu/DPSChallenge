As you can see from the plot, 50% of alcohol-related accidents result in personal injury. In hit-and-run accidents, only 5% of accidents result in injury or death. Since the rate for all observed accidents is about 23%, this could indicate that serious hit-and-runs are rare and that most drivers help injured people.
